"3","2212","- what you have learned so far
I've learned to be proactive
I've learned to pay attention to research. If you look hard enough, you will find the answers.
I've learned to ask for help.

I really want to code. I'm a total newbie and I'm hoping that I will be able to access training for beginners like me

- what you wish should be improved.
I think the way information is disseminated can be improved. It wasn't really easy getting information on what to do first, but I guess I've learned from it","2019-08-26 15:35:41","2019-08-26 15:35:41"
