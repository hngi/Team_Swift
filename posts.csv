2,1719,HTML BEGINS HERE," I am on this journey with start.ng, and here is my first HTML task. It has been a tough week combining training at my workplace in the day, and following start.ng at night. As tough as it is, I seem to be enjoying this.

  

VScode is a very good text editor for writing code, and it is just at home for HTML. For anyone who wants to learn HTML, her is the template.

  

<!Doctype html>

<html lang = ""en"">

<head>

<meta charset = ""utf-8"">

<title> whatever the title of your page is </title>

</head>

<body>

<!-- Fill me up -->

</body>

</html>

  

The doctype tells the browser, that this is an HTML document

The lang is used to determine the language you want it rendered in

The tags in the head are not displayed in the browser with the exception of the title which is displayed on the tab, to show the title of the page. The charset, is the character encoding, the universal is UTF-8.

  

The body is where everything to be displayed on the page appears.

  

Also note that there are open tags <>, and they need to be closed </>. Meta tags that don't have opening and close that, are called empty tags e.g meta tags <br>, <hr>.

  

On my CV, I used some extra elements, and attributes like anchor tag <a>, href for links and tables.

  

To cut the story short, check out my the source code for my CV using plain HTML

5,167,Task 2," A Summary on The “idongesit.html” CV, Its Structure and Tags. 

  

A HTML page is built using tags so first I need to explain what a tag is. A tag is a command in a web page that tells the browser to do something. Tags are enclosed in less than (<) and greater than (>) signs. 

 For example, <title> - this marks the beginning of the tag while </title> which comes with a backslash marks the end of the tag. Any tag can be ended with a backslash.

 The first thing is the DOCTYPE declaration of the document.

  

   <html lang=""en"">

  

  All this is doing is saying that this is the start of a HTML document.             Additionally, it specifies the language of the document, which is English.

  <head>

   <meta charset=""UTF-8"">

  

    Declaration of the character encoding: UTF-8

  

   <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">

   <meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""ie=edge"">

   <title>This shows the page title and can be seen on a browser window.  </title>

   Marks the start of the part of a HTML document called the head. This section is not visible on the webpage but it carries important information about the document.

  </head>

  <body>

    This represents the content of the document. 

  </body>

 </html> - This tag ends every HTML document.

  

In the idongesit.html document, the image was called from Cloudinary, a cloud based image and video management solution. 

The div tag is used to mark a group of consecutive elements. 

The p tag represents a paragraph. The small element represents small prints.

The hr element represents a paragraph-level break.

The br element represents a line break.

The mark element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes.

The strong element represents strong importance for its content.

6,329,My Journey on HTML,"Using the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) has been super cool with HNG.

I have learnt to arrange elements into header, body and footer elements.

I learnt to define structures using headings (h1 to h6), paragraphs(p) when needed. I learnt the use of tags; opening, closing and self closing tags.

I learnt to use hyperlinks in attribute.

I also learnt to use tables; table structures(head, body, footer), table rows(tr), table data(td).

I learnt to list items using unordered list(ul) and ordered list(ol). I used unordered list in my HTML page too. I used the strong, emphasized text and bold tags respectively. I enjoyed every bit of it.![](/storage/329/images/img-pl9l04lioy.png)",,my-journey-on-html-ce5,8/25/2019 20:54,8/28/2019 12:30,1,,,

I have learned a lot about HTML in my short period with the class on slack. HTMl being the backbone of every website is very essential to know before moving on to other technologies in web development.

We learned a lot about HTML, enough for me to make a simple CV document using just HTML. I utilised different tags we learned about in the classes. Tags such as: Header tags, Paragraph tags, Div tags, List tags (both ordered and unordered tags) were used to accomplish this simple web page.

This project has helped me to understand how each tag is interpreted by the browser; how the paragraph tag is given more space than the small tag and so forth. I also made sure I divided each section of the CV into div sections in the HTML code to give it easy readability.

Here is cheers to learning more and doing more.

I remain,

Yours in insight,

I must admit, it was pretty tough at first because I never imagined there will be a day when I will use HTML without using CSS. After being familiar with using grids,rows and columns to style pages; using tables was a virgin experience for me and I must say, I am really impressed with myself.

I discovered how to use several attributes in html that could be used for styling without using as in-line styling css or linked css file, amongst them were the font, size, face and valign attributes.

You know, I could go on and on about all I was able to accomplish using HTML, but I think I would rather show you instead.

This isn’t the first time I’m trying it out but I actually saw this through (you must be beginning to think that I am really bad at getting my tasks done; I actually am). After procrastinating my life and time away I actually got through with creating my first html page.

  

HTML is actually not so tough. I’m not saying that it’s easy, don’t get me wrong but with the help of the classes- both theoretical and practical-, I have been able to create my first html page. When starting out this task, I had to first declare the type of document it was (i.e html5) after which, I then had to write out my head and body opening and closing tags. This enables me to create a html page that will be pleasant to the eyes of those that will be viewing it. The head and body tags weren’t the only tags I made use of. I also made use of the table tags, the break line tag, the ordered and unordered list tags to mention a few. I also learnt how to include comments in my IDE. Comments are not exactly viewed on the page. No. they’re meant for other developers (if they are just so curious) to be able to understand what exactly goes on in different parts of my code. It has been a refreshing experience so far. I didn’t feel like throwing my laptop or phone away and so I believe it’s safe for me to say that I look forward to the next task!![](/storage/1929/images/img-ar11nf4kt.png)",,the-journey-so-far-e82,8/25/2019 22:10,8/28/2019 12:30,1,,,

Barely six hours with my teacher and guide, I have been able to create my own blog, coordinate my ideas on the blog, include a backlink on my post, use simple and basic applications without stress. Startng doesn't only open eyes but put brains to work , as it has done mine.

I hope to gain more knowledge on this platform, learn more about the ability of computers and applications, just maybe I could venture into programming as this platform has opened my eyes to see that understanding the computer and it's component is not that difficult.

It has always been a dream of mine to have a platform where I can develop into a complete Software Developer. Studying with HNG and and its wonderful mentors has really been of immense help in this programming journey. The seamless provision of easy to use and understand materials is top notch and the response time to queries is very commendable. 

  

   Few days into the program and we are already in task 2, here I will be sharing my experience so far on this task 2 because when this task 2 was announced I felt a bit awkward because of the timing but guess what...then comes the materials to assist novice like me and the rest they say is history as I was able to use html to write my CV in a text editor using computer codes as well as upload my portrait on the same page, my joy knew no bounds seeing the positive effects of what I have accomplished when I refreshed my chrome browser to see the changes.

44,1134,HTML Course so far on startdotng,"On Start.ng I have learnt the HTML document structure. The structuring of a Html page consists of the following:

*   DIVs which are block-level elements (block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking on top of each other and take up any available width) while SPANs are inline-level elements (inline level elements follow the normal document flow and only take up the width of their content). 
*   The major sections of pages include the head, body(Artcile, Section and Aside) and the footer
*   IDs and Classes which are attributes used in identifying and grouping elements when styling 
*   Forms which are used to receive information of the website. It includes input fields with types depending on the type of data needed.
*   Tags are used to define specific elements e.g the body tags which defines the body of the html document etc
*   It is very IMPORTANT to close tags after opening them except incases of tags that dont need a close tag e.g the image tag
*   Comments are important in writing HTML code just so another person finds it easier to read and understand your code

My desire to be a professional software engineer led me to sign up for the StartNG internship program, to be honest I never expected to be among the selected participants until I saw the congratulatory mail, it is the best mail I've received so far.

  

Though I am few hours into the program I feel like I've gained months worth of knowledge. I've been exposed to software development platforms, project management platforms and a whole lot of platforms out there I never knew existed.

  

My hunger for knowledge has been reignited, there is a lot I want to learn using this opportunity provided to me. Especially the programming and application development part of software engineering. I believe StartNG will provide me with all the knowledge I need.

The Tutors and those that guide new interns are amazing, no doubt am in for a Great experience that will take me to that height I've dreamt of.

  

In this program, I wish to learn full stack web development, web applications and mobile application.

I also wish to learn all skills the skills that will develop me and make me one of the greatest Savvy Developers out there.

  

I just want to say a very big Thanks to the organizers of this program for putting up this amazing platform.

  

Finally, I think the facilitators should improve on the awareness of the respective classes and try to add everyone to the ongoing class so that we don't miss out in any lesson.

Thanks.

I joined up for the **HNG pre-**internship program on Sunday, 18th August 2019, and so far it's been interesting, and challenging. I am still struggling to get used to the deadlines, the workplace at **Slack** and the program as a whole, but one thing is sure, if I do persevere I should be able to come out of this program a better and more refined person. This post is an update on what has been done so far.

·        What I have learnt so far

·        What I wish to still learn

·        Desired Improvements

So here's what my experience has been so far:

**WHAT I HAVE LEARNED**  **SO FAR**

The first thing I learnt networking, how to reach out and communicate with people you have never met before, this was made possible by the Slack application; a collaborative tool for teams to communicate and share ideas. This was my first time hearing about it and using it, so naturally I found it a tad challenging but with the help of the mods/Administrators and very helpful fellow interns I finally got the hang of it. I learnt about linking pages this was part of a task given to us, it did take me a while to figure it, but thankfully I did.

**WHAT I WISH TO LEARN**

I came to learn core programming; Front-end application development and maybe later add Android apps development. I also wish to improve on my social skills; how I communicate with people and build a very productive network filled with intellectuals.

**WHAT I WISH SHOULD BE IMPROVED**

**I feel certain adjustments should be made to the timetable, if classes could be held in the evenings it will bring in a lot of calm and fluidity to the internship scheme. I also wish to suggest a reduction on the amount of site we get to sign up on, some of these sites are not so easy to navigate, leading to wastage of bandwidth.**

           Well there are obvious difficulties with updating the Lucid blog, The tasks are also strange and difficult to follow, I wish the pace can be slowed down a bit so people can follow it.

64,116,BABY STEPS TO BECOMING A PROGRAMMER,"Hey guys!! so after completing task 1 which I told you guys about in my previous post, I was moved to the next stage of my Start.ng pre internship program, needless to say that it wasn’t easy finishing the first task, I had to shuttle between actively searching for a job, taking lessons and completing the task. Lucky me has found a balance and will keep advancing in that stride. After the completion of the first task, we were introduced to **HTML**, **HTML** stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It allows users create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and block quotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not in itself a programming language, but it makes it possible to organize and format documents called HTML documents, similarly to Microsoft Word. HTML documents are files that end with a .**html** or **_.htm _**extension. They can be viewed by using any web browser (Chrome, Uc browser, Opera mini, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the contents of the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users/browsers can view it. Usually, a website is a collection of related pages so using html means one has to create a lot of pages with different HTML content. For instance: home pages download pages, upload pages would all have separate HTML documents.

Now to write or create html documents, you will need an online text editor such as visual studio code, note++, Dreamweaver, Amaya and sublime text 3just to mention a few. I use Visual studio for my HTLM because I found it easy to understand and also because it was recommended. As part of task 2, we were asked to create a web page named after our full name wand with our CV as the content of that single web page, here’s what mine looks like:

  

![](/storage/116/images/img-gz14gkh0dn.png)

 Like all programming protocols/languages, HTML requires loads and loads of practice to master,  I am certain that with enough practice and dedication, I can become a professional at web design using HTM. I do hope you have enjoyed my post today, remember to follow me, I follow right back.  THANKS!!",,baby-steps-to-becoming-a-programmer-940,8/26/2019 1:23,8/28/2019 12:30,1,,,

**_First task on HTML - cv write up._**

  

First I must say that it's a new learning curve and one am proud of having to stick to the guns and see this through. I learnt alot with regards to elements, in line and block, the building of tables, went ahead to also learn the inserting of <strong> / </strong> elements to achieve a bold letter or word and the <em> / </em> the emphasize to achieve the italic design.

  

The whole process truly is opening my eyes as to the loads and loads of work that's in this field, one that I'd brace myself up to and one that I'd be willing to embark on. **_A journey of a thousand miles, they say begins with a step_** 😀- And mine has just begun.

76,2182,My Journey As a Front-end Intern with Start.NG,"Computers have always been fascinating to me. I would always wonder, “how does the computer know to display this image?”, and “how in the world are these animations on this website?”. My affinity for computers made me apply to the computer science department for my degree which I didn't get after two trials which made me settle to study Agricultural sciences, I never stopped loving computers and so I was really glad when I found out about this internship.

I wanted a big change and [start.ng](https://twitter.com/startdotng) has provided the opportunity for me to take the leap and learn the skills I would need to launch a tech career.

  

My journey as a front-end intern began today after I joined the start.ng slack channel and I am so excited to be sharing this with you.

  

My first task was to create a single HTML page with the content of my curriculum vitae,below is an image of the work done.

77,1451,MY EXPERIENCE WITH START.NG AND THE JOURNEY AHEAD,"Like every beginner who is interested in the tech world, I was. All thanks to start.ng, the pre-internship program has given me that opportunity. Though it hasn't been easy keeping up as a beginner who knows little about the tech field. It was all confusing at the beginning with different channels not knowing where to post and where not to and with so many messages to keep up it.But thanks to the clear instructions of the mentors, the links on materials which made it easier to pull through. The slack platform has really been helpful. Here, there are mentors who leads on each class, making the classes easy to understand and interesting. There are people with beautiful qualities who are willing to help and i have made impactful friendship.

  

This platform has taught me ""to do it yourself"" in that it has shown me how to use and navigate through on apps. Within a short time I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS(still hope to learn more), and also that adhering to instructions is the backbone of survival as I escaped being banned. As the journey continues, I hope to learn about frontend and to be master at it, to be efficient in other areas with each given task.

  

If there is anything i wish to be changed is to be able to get quick response to problems when task are being given and questions being asked.

78,461,My First Html: The journey,"The journey so far, has been good.

There have been plenty misconceptions, as regarding how to solve or fix grading issues, nevertheless we move regardless.

If you thought writing a cv with Microsoft Word Document was difficult, _think again_.

I indulge you to take your time with grasping everything I say/type.

HTML- HyperText Markup Language is very straightforward to grasp, but the issue is in knowing when and why to use the syntax.

How I learnt to quickly put all the necessary syntax to use, was by imaging it as plain text written on a blank document either on notes/word document.

Simply put, when writing an article/essay you already know the format at which you're going for i.e which text is going to be either a paragraph or heading.

In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.  

With that being said, _it makes work_ _easier_ to start initial task.

When compiling, this CV project, Here are the list of things I did:

1.  I made use of elements, elements are usually made of two tags. the opening and the closing tags.
2.  Anything written between the **<title>** tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.
3.  Anything written between the **<body>** tags will appear in the main browser window.
4.  The use of **<strong>** elements indicates that the element has strong importance.
5.  The **<table>** element is used to create a table.

However, the various elements used helped in forming structure in making my cv.

85,1167,How I created my CV using just HTML (No CSS or JS),"So I want to mention a few points you need to keep at heart when creating an html document,

  

1.  Semantics: HTML has a somewhat loose way of being interpreted by the browser. So your document could be visually cool, but still be a complete wreck structurally. For example, using the <div> tag with plain text in it would give the similitude of a <p> tag. You may ask, ""if it gets the job done, why worry about all that?"" I'd tell you... it makes your document (since it is indeed meant to be a document) more logical and accessible by screen readers. Trust me, you don't want a lawsuit like [this one](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/beyonces-parkwood-entertainment-sued-1172909). It also helps your Search Engine Optimization (SEO). [Read more about semantics](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271)
2.  Specificity: It's good to use classes and ID's when creating your html document, it's better to use them intelligently. Using ID names that will clearly define the section it is being used for will help your document structure. For example, using an ID ""header-section"" for the introductory section of the document is quite better than using ""num1"". Also, remember an ID is meant only to be used on a single unique element. If you want to use an identifying name for more than one element, you should give those elements a class name instead.
3.  Indentation: There's nothing as frustrating as reading illegible lines of code... trust me, there isn't. When writing your html code (as with an other code) ensure you indent properly so as to make your code more legible and make errors easier to trace. It is easier to understand the structure of a document when it is properly indented than when clustered up.

It is easier for me to find the error in this:

<div>

<h3 class=""title"">Biswal Limited, Lagos - Field Maintenance Engineer</h3>

<small class=""date"">January 2016

<p class=""role"">Role: The company offers maintenance services to telecommunications clients</p>

</div>

  

Than in this:

<div><h3 class=""title"">Biswal Limited, Lagos - Field Maintenance Engineer</h3><small class=""date"">January 2016<p class=""role"">Role: The company offers maintenance services to telecommunications clients</p></div>

  

  

Both are missing the closing </small> tag, but it s easier for me to trace that in a well-indented code

Here are screenshots of an html document created as my CV. Enjoy!

86,1802,What i have done so far on Start.Ng,"The internship program has been an exciting journey. We have been attending classes, via the slack channel.

I must commend the level of organization using technology platforms like slack, google and other mediums. It has shown clearly 

how innovative the organizers have been.

From this process, i have learnt a lot of things and i will mention theme below

  

1\. Anything is possible if you can think of it.

2\. We have not fully understood and utilize the power of technology in all of our business dealing.

3\. The grading system used on this channel is awesome.

4\. The concept of giving every one a task and letting them to complete the task and having mentors has been awesome.

5\. There has been a level of decorum and management on the part of the organizers.

6\. This program can build confidence even in someone who cannot code.

7\. In order to attain fulfillment you must be of service to others.

8\. There is potential power in team work, as the program encourages team.

9\. In the task we are encouraged to write our experience while undergoing this internship. It is also a novel idea, a it encourages 

one to improve his/her thought patterns, writing skills and presentation skills. As minute as write on a blog is, it involves critical thinking, if

you are wiling to write something that makes sense and could be read by others.

10\. The reward system is awesome.from my experience in managing people, what i can take home from this is, 

people get excited when you reward them for things they have been able to achieve in no small capacity. This program rewards people with a token for their hardwork and trying to help others succeed. Wonderful idea...

11\. Lastly, i can code, although i have been learning this on my own, however it feels good putting into practice what you have been

  

I know there so much to learn ahead, and i am more than ready to be part of this and get full internship as we go along.

We meet at the top!!!

*   How to build my portfolio website, which is of utmost important while searching for job or contracts.
*   How to use HTML only to build a beautiful site using tags like <hr>, <a>, <footer>, <br> e.t.c

90,1089,First HTML Project,"### HWGA

HWGA is not a new programming language. It's my personal code for when I feel frustrated. It means _Here we go again!_ (with a face palm obviously 😂). It also means that I am growing. Growth is not comfortable. The first HTML Project was given immediately after class. At the time, I was still fumbling around with getting lucid and blogger right! It was a humbling experience. However, I was able to get this done but I was already behind far schedule.

### HTML

I finally got down to writing the HTML. HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. According to Mozilla Development Network,

""HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

It refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.""

I wrote the HTML code, followed the hint of the mentors and used table to style the content. Admittedly, the table has been a saviour. Without it my ""website"" would have been Hiroshima after the bomb!

I used border attribute to structure the table because the instruction was to use no CSS. Here are the screenshots of the page.

Without understanding the basics of programming, learning more complex concepts will be very difficult and there's no better place to learn how to code from scratch like StartNG where we are provided with super helpful mentors and surrounded by like minded peers.

This week we started from the very alpha Html. A mark up language used to create what is called the skeleton of any webpage or software's documents to be displayed in a web browser. We learned the various html elements and how to use them. After the class we were given a task to test our knowledge on the html elements, we were asked to recreate our resume with html the best we could. I would have dropped a screenshot of my work but i am currently unable to because Lucid is in testing phase and so the upload feature is not functional at the moment, I promise to show you guys as soon as possible so you can see my work of art..",,and-the-journey-begins-e8b,8/26/2019 8:06,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

100,1659,Introduction To HTML,"What is HTML?
-------------

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is not a language in the traditional sense, but in the sense that it is a tool made of keywords and commands that programmers use to communicate with computers. HTML is used by web designers to create websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Hubpages. These examples also use various other tools, but for someone first learning about designing websites, HTML is the first tool that they should learn how to use.

In order to write HTML, you will need a text editor. A text editor is different from programs like Word that are meant for writing books or essays. Programs like word have helpful tools like paragraph styling and auto-caps, but those tools are not helpful for writing HTML, in fact, they can make it very difficult to do so. Never use Word to write HTML. On the other hand, text editors often have tools designed specifically for programming. There are many text editors out there, but I will focus on the three that I have used the most.

![](/storage/1659/images/img-epcirs106v.png)

  

Notepad and TextEdit
====================

Notepad, or TextEdit if you use a mac, is probably the most basic a text editor gets, and it is very easy to create and edit an HTML file with either of these programs. The downside is that neither Notepad or TextEdit offer any helpful tools writing HTML, but if you just want to write something quick and simple, then either of these would be sufficient to get the job done.

  

Create an HTML File
-------------------

Once you have chosen an editor, open it up and create a new file, and save it as index.html (all lowercase). The "".html"" tell internet browsers that this file contains HTML, and the name ""index"" tells the browsers that this will be your websites default home page. You can actually open this file in your web browser now and view it, but it would just be an empty page, so let's add some text to it! Go ahead and copy and paste the text below into your index.html file.

  

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<``html` `lang``=``""en""``>`

`<``head``>`

`</``head``>`

`<``body``>`

`Hello World!!`

`WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!!`

`</``body``>`

`</``html``>`

  

View Your File in a Browser
---------------------------

I will explain what each line means, but first let's see what your website looks like. Go ahead and save your file again. To open your file in a browser, right click on the file and select ""open with"", then select your browser (see image below.)

![Open with browser](https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/13880528_f496.jpg)

Your browser should open up to a page similar to the image below.

  

![Hello world](https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/13880520.png)_H_

Congratulations, you have created a simple website! It may not look like much now, but all websites start off small, and with a little more time and effort we can make it into something much prettier.

Explaining the Code
-------------------

Now, I wouldn't be a very good teacher if I didn't explain the code we just used, so let's go ahead and jump right into it. Open you file again, and we'll go over the code line by line. If your file opens in a browser when you try clicking it, right-click the file and select ""open with"" again, but this time select your editor instead of a browser.

This first line simply tells the browser what programming language the file is in.

  

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

These two lines are called opening and closing tags. An opening tag tells the browser when a specific section of your website will begin, and the closing tags tells where it will end. It is traditional to indent any lines placed between matching tags so that your text is easier to understand. pressing tab on your keyboard will create an indent on the currently selected line. These specific tags are called HTML tags, and they tell the browser that everything between them is HTML. The ""lang=""en"" part is so the browser knows to expect the inside text to be in English.

  

  

  

`<html lang=``""en""``>`

`</html>`

These are the head tags. Text placed between these tags will not appear on your website. This section is where the code goes that tells the browser what the website's title is, where to get styling tools like special fonts, and where the tab icon for your website is stored. For this project, we will leave this section empty.

  

  

`<head>`

`</head>`

  

Anything that you want to appear on your website you will place between these body tags. This will be the ""body"" of your website.

  

  

`<body>`

  

`</body>`

  

This is plain text. any plain text placed inside your body tags will appear on the website. Some special character like ""&"" will not appear on your website, but they are possible to show using character references. For example, ""Tom &amp; Jerry"" will look like ""Tom & Jerry"" on your website.

  

  

`Hello World!!`

`WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!!`

All together, these tools can be used to create a simple website.

  

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<html lang=``""en""``>`

`<head>`

`</head>`

`<body>`

`Hello World!!`

`WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!!`

`</body>`

`</html>`

133,1886,HTML short practice,"Many thanks to the instructors at HNG internship

So far i have cone to understand some basics in HTML...let me take you through briefly.

...

First things first, what's HTML.

Hypertext Markup Language. (html) is an essential part of website development.

**_Basically Html +CSS = website_**_._

Html makes up the basics structure of a webpage and its makes specially programming tools in its execution. This includes elements, tags, attributes etc. All this tools work and in hand e.g an element (heading or paragraph) must be accompanied by a opening and closing tag (<, >)

**Elements:** common elements include heading and paragraph. Their are symbolized with d h and p respectively. Headings range from h1 to h6.

**Tag**: tags are used to give an element meaning when writing codes. Meaning an element MUST have an opening an a closing tag e.g a heading will appear <h> and </h> for opening and closing tags respectively while a paragraph will also be written in similar forms.

I have learnt several other ways of using the html and i am gradually mastering the tool( one step at a time though time as not been friendly). Here is a sample of my work, its just a simple aspect and still in progress. I will show you as it grows.

**Solomon Eyitene**
===================

  

I am a Graphic Designer and I am a Frontend Developer who is seeking to learn more to improve on my exisiting knowledge currently.

I began learning about web development properly in 2016 but have a poor foundations and delays.

Currently I have studied a lot in Web development and I know for sure that I have a good ground to stand on when it comes to web development.

  

**MY SKIILS**

During all my time studying I have learnt a few things in web development such as

*   HTML5
*   CSS and CSS3
*   CSS Transitions and Animation( though still learning it)
*   SASS ( I encountered SASS but recently and just the basic)
*   Bootstrap 4
*   JavaScript (Amateur)
*   JQuery (Amateur )

  

**MY WISH**

I wish I could learn a whole lot on Javascript and javascript framework such as vue.Js to improve on my frontend development skills and take me to a new level. I am opened to learning about Javascript(ES6) and become experienced in it.

  

I would love to improve my CSS into an advanced level and UI designing also( prototyping, wireframes, etc) as well as my Javascript.

  

I am happy I got to join startNg internship program which will help me improve on this skiils on a whole new level.

Johnson Afokolu, Victor Michael and Jacob Usang were arrested on Saturday morning by a police patrol team that saw them allegedly taking position to attack early travellers.

  

The suspects were said to have attempted to flee when they sighted the policemen but were chased and apprehended.

  

It was gathered that a toy gun, knife, phones, substances suspected to be Marijuana, military accoutrements and torches were from them.

  

“They confessed to have been responsible for most armed robbery cases in the area and that other members of the gang usually joined them on special operations,” said police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP).

  

He said the Commissioner of Police Bashir Makama has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for discreet investigation while massive manhunt for their accomplices have commenced.",News-Lifestyle,police-in-ogun-arrested-three-highway-robbery-gang-096,8/26/2019 14:56,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
175,403,My first Post while on StartNG pre-internship.,"Hello world! What can I say about my experience so far in the pre-internship? First what do I know about the StartNG re-internship? Its a remote program hosted by HNG, to help train professional developers in Front-end, back-end, machine learning, digital skills, amongst others. So far so good I am going through some tasks to enable me learn a little in digital skills.

I already have a little experience in working remotely, as i am a self taught Developer working as a UI/UX Developer. The thing is I want to relearn some of the things I started out with, get back to the basics, these days we lose touch with what is really important when trying to reach a set goal. And sometimes skip important lessons.

There were some questions asked by different mentors in the groups in the form of games in which getting it right earns you a reward. That is a plus. Those that don't get the answer fast enough or don't answer at all pick up one or two things from what others have dropped. I am learning a little more on tweeting and blogging.

It isn't easy to handle a bunch of us learners with our questions, our unintended ungrateful retorts and assumptions. I believe there is always room to improve when it comes to imparting knowledge, so far the whole team is doing good managing us on the slack group. I believe we should always try to reach out to more and more people and teach them all these things as startng/HNG are.

I think the the lucid platform is a nice piece of work though it is progressing a little slowly. I saw a post from Mentor Mark Essien earlier, stating that laravel developers can join in the project in order to improve on it. also the #lucid\_feedback channel in slack is available for feedback on the platform.

I am grateful to be in this platform reading refreshing questions and relative answers that help ground me even further in what i still believe I am great at.",,my-first-post-while-on-startng-pre-internship-cf8,8/26/2019 15:01,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

So I faced it head on, in architecture, presentation is yours but time stands between you and your lecturer, in this case, now client (deadline).

Same as this but much more at my convenient to study and practice.

I decided to put time behind and make it a point of note to actually pay attention to details instead of rushing to submit the task with others.

So far, so good and I pray that God keep the fire burning in me to continue to the end...

Not giving up.￼

225,2218,My HNG Internship Programming Experience,"Programming its the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer ""languages,"" such as SQL, Java, Python, and also web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.

  

A programmer is therefore, Someone who writes code or programs to tell the computer what to do.

becoming a programmer is not an easy road to take but yet so easy to learn especially when you have good instructors, Mentors, Books, Tutorial Videos and lots more now everywhere on the internet.

  

A good example of such great resource for Becoming a programmer is HNG Internship 6.0 which offers the best on hands practice in the world of programming. this program is for beginners like me who wants to learn how to code.

  

Thanks to this program while trying to complete task One, I accomplished a lot;

*   Used Google documents, which I used their template to properly develop and structure my CV.
*   I created a Blog using Blogger, Never knew it was that easy.
*   Read about Italy and majorly the beautiful city of Milan as the first topic of post on my blog.
*   Read about Github and Git, although I've not used it yet but am eager to learn how to create projects.

  

In the course of this task i came across PivotalTracker, Cloudinary, and many more, I cant wait to learn about them and use them. I am hoping that i will learn more on web design to further improve my front-end skills before the completion of this program.

Finally, I wish to commend because I am impressed and have not yet seen a flaw to be improved.

242,2224,Niro's Start.ng journey so far,"If you're reading this, then it means you are interested in following my software developer journey. Although this is part of requirements for me to complete one stage of a task I am working on, I am interested in documenting my journey to becoming a guy who ""writes stuff that works on computers"" as Timi Ajiboye puts it.

  

At this point I've learnt how to make back links and also setup Wordpress accounts--something I have not done in over five years. It was quite challenging seeing as I've not done it in a while, but after a few false starts I was able to complete it.

  

I hope that by the time the start.ng program is done, I should be able to write codes that work regardless of how many bugs that come with them. One thing I learnt in my information security classes in grad school is that this is not necessarily a bad thing because all programs contain vulnerabilities.

  

It is the first time I am following the Start.ng path and I do not know how things like these work. One thing I would love to improve though would be the software that is used to teach the classes. I feel a learning management system should be used for teaching and slack used for other communication because the current system makes it such that you may get overwhelmed with messages and important messages are lost to Slack's limitations for free accounts.

  

Asides that it's all good. I am trying to complete the tasks as soon as I can although I am moving at a slow pace as I cannot sit upright for long periods of time due to pains from a surgery I underwent last week. However, I'll try to make this as fast as I can so I don't get eliminated.

  

Until next time,

243,1947,My experience with  StartNG Task 2,"Another stage of the startNG program began last week. We were given the task to crate an html page without using css. The page should be filled with the content of our CV.

  

I logged to my Visual Studio code to begin the assignment. I created the !DOCTYPE html to indicate the version of the html. It was followed by creating the html element. Inside the html element, I created two elements- head and body.

  

![](/storage/1947/images/img-8689x0v37z.png)

**_credit: A screenshot of my html page_**

  

The real job happened in the body element because it is the part that enables your code to display on the web browser. To fill the html page with information on my cv, I needed to use some other elements.They include <h3>,<p>, <strong>, <table>, <hr>, and <ul>.

256,2227,A Developer's Journey,"Lao Tzu once said, ""the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step"". Whatever we want to accomplish in life always has a starting point. The place where it all began.

  

For as long as I can remember, I've been around computers. I played games mostly with them, but I learned a couple of skills as well. I learned how to type really quickly at a young age, and (considering that back then most of my peers did even know where the letters of the alphabet were on the keyboard) I fancied myself a whiz. A computer genius.

  

As I grew up, I began to discover that my computing skills were barely scratching the surface, and there was a lot more to a computer than just knowing how to type. I had told myself that I was a genius for so long that it made me relax too much. I was way behind.

  

So I decided to step up my game. I took a lot of courses mostly in graphic design, watched hours of Youtube videos, and got better at design. I decided to learn how to build websites so I could market my skills to a wider audience, and after watching a couple more videos, trying and failing so many times, I have made it to this point. Start.Ng.

  

There are a couple of things I've learned so far:

  

**Software Development is Broad**

There is no single person on this earth that can come out and say that he/she knows everything there is to know about software development. There are so many programming languages, skillsets, frameworks and tools to use that it is easy to get lost in it if there's no proper guidance.

  

**Development Skills Matter, People Skills are Extremely Important**

Since I started on the HNG Pre-internship, I've had the opportunity to meet a lot of talented developers and designers, who are all eager to learn, and one thing I've discovered about them is that nobody claims to know everything. Everyone is just out to help each other grow, make meaningful connections and form strong bonds that go beyond software development. I has helped me to work more on my people skills and become more emphatic and realize that I'm never alone.

  

**Writing Skills are important too**

Since I started on this intership, I've had to write two blogs. That is more than I've ever written in my life in one week. I've had to do a lot of research on what works and what doesn't, and also how to organize my thoughts. It's been an enjoyable journey so far, and I think I'm beginning to love writing. Who knew right?

  

**Working Towards Goals**

I've spent a lot of time trying to learn how to design and code, and the major problem I usually have is that I finish up my tutorial videos. I am easily distracted. However, having a set of tasks and a time frame as start.ng provides has helped to make me more focused and now I can confidently say that not only am I finishing up my tasks in record time, but I am also enjoying the workflow.

  

I am very grateful that I have been given this opportunity to learn, and I wish that by the end of this program, I will turn out to be a very good frontend developer, with amazing people skills, and a lot of confidence in my capacity.

  

There really isn't much I think should be improved on for now, everything is okay and I love it. Thanks start.ng!",,a-developers-journey-53e,8/26/2019 17:25,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

279,7,SHALLOW THINKING,"It's quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you. For example, you can read a few books, do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru. But that's mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D.

In a place without a large density of engineers, it's very easy to do this. It's easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking, or SEO or Google Adwords, and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them, you are instantly seen as a guru.

People will start inviting you to give talks, your peers will refer to you as 'that genius', people will be hailing you.

You can't stop the above from happening, but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it.

It's relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything. It's actually trivially easy. But you will never, ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success.

A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners, novices or people who are just starting.

If you are truly good, you will be teaching intermediates or experts. Never beginners. The biggest coaches are always training experts, never starters.

To not fall into this trap, you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level. It sounds harsh, but if you don't do this, you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up. So you will see all you have achieved (which is very comforting), instead of all you have not achieved (which is much harder to look at).

Once you are at an advanced level, then you can start teaching others, and you are now teaching it much better.

I see this phenomena all too often - people looking for the praise and kudos of non-experts. They get it, and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts.",,shallow-thinking-908,8/26/2019 18:54,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
280,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS.NG,"Hotels.ng is about two years old now. In the first year, it was just a website — no business built around it. It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels. The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria. I listed them all on the site and put the site up. Only 100 of those hotels had pictures. The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.

In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.

We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.

Some time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng. I went to Lagos, we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian, then I returned to Calabar. The next day, they made an offer. A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels.ng received funds from Spark.

In the last 1 year, I used the investment money to build Hotels.ng into a company. We have 15 full-time staff, 5 contract staff and more than 70 ad-hoc staff. Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site. We now have 5080 hotels on the site. We have full pictures for 4000+ of all those hotels. We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels — we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online.

The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2.3 million USD. That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site. By its very existence, it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it.

By the end of the year 2013 we hit $40k in monthly revenue. I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been.

How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria? Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not, but that’s not how it is on the inside.

The past two years have been like climbing a mountain — blindfolded. To do what we are doing, there is no roadmap. There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before. So it was all experiments and trial-and-error. I never knew what would work and what would not, so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good. And even when you find something that works, you need growth, so you need to find what works even better.

From composing the teams, deciding how to approach hotels, getting people across 36 states in Nigeria, figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet, and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working, it has all been a journey of uncertainty.

### **GETTING STARTED WITH $50K**

Our initial raise was $75k, of which $25k went to buy a car (to close deals in Lagos). So we had $50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people. That’s N8 million. At the time, I though that it would be more than enough. But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are. If you have N8mill for 6 months, you have about 1.3m per month. Salaries will take half that money. Developer will take a big chunk. Data purchase another big chunk. The money will finish very rapidly.

So we had to do another raise with Spark, this time $150k. In the first 6 months, the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties.

My take-away from the initial raising money is this: If you are going to raise money for something complicated, make sure the money will last at least 1 year. You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round.

### **THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS**

When we first started, I had no idea how to build a team. I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people. Initially, we had the system where everything was being controlled by me. After some wise advice from Victor Asemota, I split up into smaller units with team leaders. This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance.

Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase — they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring, and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be. Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt, which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles. So (forgive me for this, co-workers), a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person/job-fit.

During this period, we had to figure out how to make things work. Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels, but back then I genuinely did not know. I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently, how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us.

And most importantly, how do you do this across 4000+ hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with? The first 6 months was just about building the processes, building the software systems we needed to manage this, figuring out how to field deploy people, etc.

The key take-aways from this period to me is: The things you do internally, they may seem super easy when you have figured them out, but they are not easy to discover. You cannot copy a company from the outside. Also, very importantly, a word is enough for the wise! When you have a problem, someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place. Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing!

After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels.ng, things started running on their own. I was no longer an essential part of the process. So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany. That holiday was super-useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me. I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you. If it requires you to be there, then it is not a scalable business.

So the day I came back, a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important. I asked him what he was. He paused, then said: Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website. It’s just like yours.

Rocket Internet. The guys with five hundred million dollars. Coming up against me. I had barely $70,000. I started sweating.

I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria. I searched my email for the pitch-deck to see if it gave away anything. Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business. That would not help them.

How do we beat Rocket Internet? They had everything. Over the following week, I kept thinking about that. But then I noticed something — they kept studying us, trying to find out how we did it. They were trying to beat US.

That’s when I realised that somehow or the other, barely knowing it, we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa. So I didn’t have to beat Rocket Internet, they had to beat me.

If you think of it in battle terms, at this point we have two armies, both moving in darkness, trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location. The battle has not started. We were in the deployment phase, and we were far ahead.

So far, we had moved much faster than them. We had done smart things. Even when they started moving, we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count. And at a fraction of what they spent. Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone.

So on reflection, I understood how we could beat them. In this movement phase, I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us. At some point in the future, both sides would have arrived and it’s time to start the actual battle (which involves having the site the customers prefer to use). A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you. In both of those aspects, if this were something that more money means you must automatically win, then there would be no instagram or snapchat.

I don’t know what the future will bring, but I know that the team we have at Hotels.ng is good enough to win, even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket. They have been around for 6 months now, and barely dented our number 1 position. The way we move will make it stay that way.

### **THE HASSLES**

When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is, with a lot of old rich men involved, you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do.

We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors — from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do, to our cars getting arrested.

This is Nigeria. This is Africa. This is normal. My advice: Have backup, have friends in high places, because if you truly disrupt, you will need their help to solve problems.

The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems. You have to know that there will be major problems, and you just solve them and keep going, without ever being distracted from the mission and vision.

### **FIRING PEOPLE**

It’s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them. But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care-taker of a company. You are there to do the best for the company. If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company, a CEO is obliged to lay the person off.

I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire. Because we are all humans and all kind — when you know someone well, you may be hesitant to do what’s best for the company because of pity.

### **THE TECH SCENE**

What we are building is not in isolation, it’s in the middle of the tech scene. This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me. I have never been a big fan of Lagos, but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be. It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area.

Since coming to Lagos, I have met a large number of the “twitter famous” people. Each of those people have straight-up provided me with ideas or information. And those words really made a difference.

I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community, it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy. One person discovers something, tells someone else. And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business.

The Nigerian tech community is small, but it is helpful. It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country. The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa, and in my opinion, I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy.

These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent. They have the ability to change and transform it. They are what will create the future industries. So no matter what, we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco-system.

### **FINAL WORDS**

Building Hotels.ng has been hard. But it’s worth it to look at the site/business and see it working. See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running. All of this was done with the help of a larger technology eco-system, people who were willing to risk capital and the persistence and hard work of the team.

It’s been a good two years. Looking forward to the next two!",,two-years-in-the-trenches-building-hotelsng-8e2,8/26/2019 18:54,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

282,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE-HIT WONDER,"Most people, at some point, have a hit. Some hit blog post, some hit song, some hit startup, some great party and so on. But then that’s it. They try again, but it just doesn’t work the second time around. They try to do things exactly the same way, but it just does not work. Why is this? Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better, while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce?

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**
--------------------

Think of some guy cooking dinner. He goes crazy, throwing various ingredients in the pot, roasting the meat on an open flame, flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan, and randomly selects some red wine from the shop.

He invites his friends for dinner, and they are astounded. The meal is perfect – the meat is just right, the wine works perfectly, the soups are just perfectly flavored.

That guy just landed a hit. But it’s a hit he cannot reproduce. He does not know why that meal was so good, because he was just throwing things into the pot. He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck. Give him different ingredients, a different stove and he will make a terrible meal.

Contrast that with a professional cook. He can consistently give you a good meal, independent of what he has available to him. Sometimes, even the pro will make a dud, but most of the time, it will turn out right.

The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals. He has studied the theory behind what he is doing, or he has a huge wealth of experience. He knows how to sear meat, he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish. So what the other guy did by chance, he can consistently do.

Most one-hit wonders just don’t have the fundamentals. They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit, they will not understand how that hit came about. A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him – he will recognize new things, but the other person will take nothing new from the experience.

**THE SOCIAL NETWORK**
----------------------

The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people. And these people don’t want anything to do with you. They don’t have the time to talk to any guy off the street. But when you have your hit, they will all want to talk to you. For a while.

The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society. Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit.

You can’t keep repeating one thing that worked. It gets boring. You can’t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit. You can’t keep cooking the same dish. You can’t keep making the same website. You will need to make something new. And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you.

It’s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record. Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song. It’s easy for her to land another hit, because all the best producers will want to work with her. Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high.

Some people, after landing their hit, don’t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That’s very difficult.

**THE HIT FACTORY**
-------------------

The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors – he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals, and when he lands that hit that makes him visible, he leverages the new social network this opens to him. He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit.",,how-to-avoid-being-a-one-hit-wonder-e90,8/26/2019 18:57,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
283,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.

For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.

There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.

Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.

First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!

For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.

If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.

If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.

If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.

Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.

Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.",,build-around-your-discovery-mechanism-f7d,8/26/2019 18:57,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
284,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD?,"A few years ago, I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics. One day at a company party, a young guy about 24 years old, roughly my age, walked up to me and introduced himself. He was a new recruit and was working in business development. He was funny, charming and intelligent. Over the next 6 months, I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management, jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years.

I’ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods, because they were efficiently effective.

Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. People talk about cut-throat business, but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other. So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way, for him it’s like taking candy from a baby. Or to put it in more realistic terms, taking a lot of money from a soft, slightly pudgy nerd.

What I’d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul – and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful.

1.  **Choose your friends**: Saul always had a lot friends, but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him. For example, when I first knew Saul, he was working as an entry-level employee in a large company. He was friends with everyone. He got friendly with the boss, and 6 months later, he was a manager. His old friends said that Saul would walk by them, chatting and laughing with the managers, and it would be like they never existed.

A core of Saul’s strategy, as he once explained was this – you can’t have a million close friends. You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher, and for that, you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back.

When Saul needed something, he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could. For example, when he made his play to get into management, he first became friends with his boss, and when his boss took him out, Saul got to know all the other managers, and became their friends.

When Saul wanted to get to know women, he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women, and he became their friend. Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short-term like that – he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward.

1.  **Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect**: GTL – Gym, Tan, Laundry. Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance, and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes, good shoes and a good body. He actually wears light make-up. It may seem vain, but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women, and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success.

To expand his contacts, he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in. And for the women to be interested in him, he micro-managed his body and dressing to the smallest details.

And let’s face it – have you seen many top management who look grubby? Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership.

1.  **Invest in your location**: Saul spent an extra-ordinary percentage of his income on his home. He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area, and furnishing his place really nicely.

One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home, and when people came in, they would be visibly impressed, and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes.

Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff. At any social gathering, Saul would work to navigate the group to these ‘safe’ territories, where he would then be in control of the situation.

1.  **Approach people and tell them what to do**: Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do. Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen, Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them, or to do something for them.

For example, when new clients were brought on a tour of the company, he stood up and joined the entourage, chatting with the clients. The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted, and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President, who was leading the people around the office.

1.  **Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush**: Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action, Saul would always sit back and wait. He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on – which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes.

On company outings, Saul would drink just a little, while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount. This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group – and this was key to him assuming a de-facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department.

What this brought him: Saul, shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department. He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department, and after a couple of months, she promoted him to something with an office, I’m not sure what.

Then she changed department, and because he had become the de-facto leader of the group, she recommended him for her job. He took over the job, and became close friends with most of the mid-level management. After a couple of months of hard-work, he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted. He was promoted after a negotiation period.

Now, five years later I heard he’s running a department with more than a thousand people below him. When people talk about him, they don’t dislike him; they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead. By building relationships, and by ending relationships when they were hampering him, he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve.",,are-you-capable-of-being-ruthless-to-get-ahead-259,8/26/2019 18:58,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
285,1235,My First HTML Page,"**HTML So Far**

Learning HTML during this HNG internship programs has allowed to know more about the language and it has also introduced me to new tags and attributes used in the language. The assignment to format our resume in HTML also brought clarity to the usage of some of these tags. Although it took a while to get my hand wrapped around some methodologies, it however was an experience that I totally enjoyed.

  

I have however realized from this training that there are several ways to achieve a task but some routes are better and with the help of some of the mentors and class members, it was a hitch-free journey to coding my first script.

  

Some of the things I learnt was format each heading with different sizes with the <h>, assigning information to paragraphs with <p> tag, the <li> tag was used to list items in the HTML page, the table tag was used to arrange information in a table arrangement and how to aesthetically arrange the codes to easily review it.

286,7,DO YOU NEED A CO-FOUNDER?,"Co-founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail. If you don’t have any co-founders, when you hit that dip, that speed bump along the road, you will be unable to continue. There will be nobody to talk to, nobody to brainstorm with, nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things. When the customers are complaining, when you hit an impossible bug, without a co-founder, it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work.

But with a co-founder, the situation can be even worse. It’s a bit like being married – if the marriage works out well, it’s way better than being single. But if the marriage turns out terrible, being single would be heavenly.

A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area, I had a client called Eric. He was a soft spoken guy, incredibly nice, but he always had this air of sadness around him. Once, we were chatting in the evening, and he suddenly started telling me his life story. He had been running a software business with a co-founder from college, and the business had just started taking off. Suddenly, his co-founder started acting over-bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business. They started fighting, they disagreed on some core features, and at some point, Eric came back home and he could not access the servers. An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash.

The co-founders of small startups have very personal relationships. The line between family, friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other. Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close. Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers, people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things.

**HOW CO-FOUNDERS SHOULD BE**
-----------------------------

Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern, having an ale and then a man walks in and says – which of you men here is ready to join me in war, and have your chance at fame and fortune? You will immediately size up the man and decide – can I do battle with this man by my side? Can I follow this man? Can I trust this man? Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune, or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field?

A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co- found a company with.

And yes, a partnership is never really equal. There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others. There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes. This just does not work. Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others, even though they are almost equal, being not quite equal.

Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights. The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I’d bring made, but as soon as there is cash, the clashes will start.

There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company. That’s just how the big apes roll.

**SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY, HUH?**
----------------------------------------

Don’t just go for the obvious co-founder person around you. You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT, this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you.

Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with. Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best. When you want to get serious with a co-founder, make sure you have really worked together for a while.

When you have someone you want to work with, you will know pretty quickly. It’s like meeting the right girl – you know quite quickly this is the person for you. But to find that person, you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first. Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away, or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend.

**PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS**
--------------------------------------------

Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company, but it does not scale. Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights, and in small companies, this can be devastating to morale and your productivity. As a company grows, relationships should be formalized. People who are friends should be friends, but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this.

Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working. It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab, but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows. And the company in the end is there to make money, and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work, are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people, and has their space to be productive in.

**THE STORY OF ERIC, COMPLETED**
--------------------------------

Eric, after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software. I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software. He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion, and together we designed a good business model.

When the software was done, he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus. He launched the software and now, a few years later, he is one of the biggest players in the media world. I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out-competed his old company to pieces. He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it, he fixed the broken parts.

And when the big payout came, he did not have to share with anyone. Last I spoke to him, he has a lovely wife and is quite happy.

Business building is about relationships in no small way. When you start a company, keep that in mind, and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you.",,do-you-need-a-co-founder-989,8/26/2019 19:00,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,
287,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,"The only true currency we humans have is time. Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born, and every day they take out a little from it. One dreaded day, the pot is empty.

People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time. So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time, like the automobile or the telephone.

The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves. If it costs $100/hour to produce a screwdriver, and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours, then every reasonable company would pay at least $100 to purchase that product.

That is the essence of many software business. Save a business or person some time, so they can go make more money. The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business.

![Evaluation Framework](https://markessien.com/content/images/2015/11/0-50Gvmue3SqekS13M.png)

The chart above demonstrates this. You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart.

For example, lets look at the chart for the invention of the car. The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done. It also did this for something that was done very often (travel) and done by basically everyone. So the value generated by the car was huge.",,evaluating-startup-ideas-82a,8/26/2019 19:00,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

<p>It's a new day, what were you able to achieve today? Mine was quite stressful, but there was a cool win for me. I have been running Linux mint, and my root partition was running low on space (I partitioned 15gb only initially). I had 60gb allocated space but someone, adding this to my existing partition was a huge pain. I dedicated most of today to get that solved, and voila, I actually did. So I've double my root (about 30gb in all now) and my home partition also got an extra 30gb (so about 70~80gb now). I'm dual booting and my windows still has about 350gb worth of my total 500gb (actually 450gb) space. Little wins, but it's so great to finally sort this out.</p>

It's a love that wont let go.and Lastly, for now,(4) Google is the ultimate uncoditional friend that would never shame me for not knowing what i'm supposed to know and show me steps of the way how to be amazing at what i know i can be at.

355,1799,My Experience in Designing a HTML Web Page as a Pre-Intern on Startng,"Learning HTML as a total beginner was quite hard as first. Because I had to read several notes and watch several videos at first. These videos is actually worth it. I believe that this training is my foundation on programming and learning digital marketing and front-end programming.

We used html 5, which is the latest standard of its version. We were able to build a web page/web site using only html (that is without using CSS or JS). Emphasis where made on closing tags as it is key if a document is written correctly. Startng made us to understand that the best way to learn is to practice as well. Using the “Visual Studio code”, I was able to design a web site/page successfully today, which the screen short of my work is attached here below.

The screen short of the web page designed is shown below:

The wait is over, and our hands are already getting dirty. After the HTML/CSS classes we were posed with a challenge to recreate our CV using html strictly.

I jumped on the task using Html alone with a bit of creativity. The result is that of the picture of above.

  

After the class I came to understand that HTML is like a building with no design/decoration whatsoever and CSS is used to add designs/decoration to the building.

379,711,A date with HTML ,"![](/storage/711/images/img-mwjqojh52d.png)

[Start.ng](http://www.start.ng/) has been awesome.

  

On Tuesday, 20th August 2019,  we were introduced to

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts; 

  

See screenshots below

So far in this program, I have learnt a lot! To start with, This program has opened my eyes to know many platforms Developers can utilize in there development activities, one of this places is Cloudinary, truth be told, before now I don't know about this place and what I can use it for.

  

Also, I can now comfortably use Slack work desk comfortable and play around using google docs and all that. All thanks to **StartNG** Internship and all the mentors in there.

  

Most importantly, I have learnt **HTML5**!!! I was able to use it to design an amazing CV. I never knew I would have been able to actualize such CV with just HTML alone.

I have learnt very well how to use tables, colors, headings, paragraphs and inserting of images and links.

  

Indeed am happy and I know this is just the beginning that the best is yet to come.

Thanks for empowering me StartNG Internship.

Over the years I've tried to learn programming through self learning. I started several times and stopped several times. I was confused at some point. School work and exams didn't make it easy till I gave up at some point.

During NYSC camp, I attended a free coding session as my SAED, Tutors and Learners World. I continued after camp. There I learnt alot and could finally refocus and have some clarity. I can proudly say that I benefited from NYSC.

  

I have learnt HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node JS. I want to brush up on my Javascript and learn some Python and probably go into machine learning in the near future.

  

I am looking forward to interact with people in the tech community and make some relevant contributions.

[**StartNG**](https://start.ng/) is a community of young, vibrant, focused Nigerians that have agreed to make a difference of who they are and who they want to be, from the mediocrity to supremacy and i can confidently say that it is being achieved.

  

**WHAT I HAVE LEARNT**

From my first warm welcome in the slack classes by many fellow intellectuals i could see love and concern, teamwork and relativity. Everyone was ready to help the next and resources where just available from all corners.

  

The bedrock of programming was taught; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and with this two knowledge a good, simple, responsive website i can now build.

  

**WHAT I WISH TO STILL LEARN**

I am a very inquisitive person that want to learn (if possible) everything the world has inside it (obviously not possible). I always want to know how everything functions around me and i have seen that they are all connected by frequencies and these frequencies can be represented in computer language (0s and 1s) which then speaks that with a good knowledge in Information Technology i can learn how the world functions.

  

Data Science, Machine Learning, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence are some fields in the Tech Industry that thrills me added with the latest discoveries they sprung up daily, i always want to know how they breathe, think and act.

  

**WHAT I WISH TO BE IMPROVED**

At the moment i haven't seen much to that needs improvement only if in the slack classroom, i will advice if possible the moment a user logs into the slack community FOR THE FIRST TIME, he should be greeted with the ""Course Outline and Tasks at hand"". It's quite stressful to be asking around people how to go about the task and where to get the resource from. It can be imputed in the **""greetbot""** and would save lots of stress in getting that from the classrooms.

Aside that nothing else for now that i feel should be improved.

  

I look forward to much development, learning and building from my StartNG Community.

  

Thank you.

422,1614,Communication,"Every day communication evolves not just in the way we say things. But effective communication comes with doing.In the theatrics of our world even silence is communicating something. More people spend extra algorithm to get the perception of buyer to predict what buyers frequently buy so they can better communicate to the needs of the buyer.

We live in a world now, Where scarier things are being done but when you talk about it, you are the scarier one. Behavioural psychologist spend time in neuron-network to compute how the human brain works to predict behaviour some things are not so simple any more. We think we have communication but we have lost privacy because knowledge is not towards communicating but to use this knowledge to the advantage of the one who knows.

I remember the behavioral story of the ""free-rider"" problem, where nets was distributed to a community in Uganda. But they later asked them to pay a little for these mosquito net. Much of world operates like these, communication was free till they get a way to sensor it. ""Most people claim"" fake news are being circulated but if its fake news why then are you worried about it. We lived in times before when people had good and bad reports but no one said it was fake news. Global claim to fruition is like this for me; we are in a time where if you give those free net to a couple of people; you have successfully communicated to all to pay for those nets. And if you deter others from this knowledge, all of a sudden you are the bitter one with anguish from the past.

You know that enthusiasm you get when you about to embark on a new interesting task?

For someone with some knowledge in HTML scripting language, inspiration on how carry out soon came, almost naturally I must say.

Though I encountered challenges styling the page without CSS, but it was really fun and interesting at the end. I must say, working HTML alone has taught me to strive for the best, no matter how limited an option I have.

Although I am wish to gist you in full how my experience with HTML was, believe me this page won't contain all the words I'd input.

Candidly, I must let you know that it is the first time I am using most of the Apps that I was asked to sign up for and use to execute the various sub-tasks in Task 1. Yours truly must also confess that I only heard the names of some of those Apps for the first time when reading the instructions for Task 1.

  

So far so good, in the course of carrying out the sub-tasks that made up Task 1, I learnt how to do the followings:

*   Use Google Docs to create and share a document; the document turned out to be my CV in this case.
*   Sign Up for a GitHub Account
*   Sign Up for a Pivotal Tracker Account
*   Sign Up for a Cloudinary Account 
*   Sign Up for a Blogger Account on Blogspot and wrote a post about Travel & Tourism to South Africa
*   Link my Blog Post to an inner page on timbu.com
*   Sign Up a Lucid Account and write a post on the platform.

  

I am enthusiastically looking forward to learning and making more discovery about what it takes to be a true Web Developer. Beyond that I want to learn the practical skills that will make me a better Web Developer.

  

Going forward for improvement, I wish there could be more mentors to handle the grading of Tasks as they are submitted by Interns so that the waiting time can be minimized.

  

I want to use this opportunity to thank the untiring team of mentors and programme facilitators at Start.NG and hng.tech for the good job they are doing. Thank you all.",Technology,startng-pre-internship-my-task-1-learning-experience-f25,8/27/2019 2:37,8/28/2019 12:30,,,,

Google have been my room mate it really helps me a lot to do quick search when ever am lost or about to give up.Working with Html was fun and just like telling a child to do something and he/she do exactly as you asked them to do. example of what i mean is that is if you want a text to be bold just tell the text <b>let this text be bold</b>, if you want to list points <li>list this point</li> and so on.

647,1591,How To Create A simple CV Using HTML,"What would you do if you need urgent information about affordable hotel reservations in Abuja? You would most like very quickly go straight to your Android or iOS mobile device, search for [hotels.ng](https://hotels.ng/hotels-in-abuja) on Google and get the exact information you need.

Well, this is made possible by the World Wide Web or the abbreviation W.W.W. What you probably didn’t know is that at the core of the World Wide Web is HTML.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page with a series of elements. These elements are represented by <tags>.

Let’s take a look at HTML terms before we go straight into creating a simple CV.

Elements

As said earlier, elements define the structure and contents of the objects of a web page and are enclosed in <angel bracket>, for instance:

·        The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

·        The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

·        The <head> element contains meta information about the document

·        The <title> element specifies a title for the document

·        The <body> element contains the visible page content

·        The <h1> element defines a large heading, also h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 defines smaller headings

·        The <p> element defines a paragraph.

·        The <strong> elements defines a **Bold** text.

·        The list goes on and on.

Tags

An element surrounded by angel bracket makes it a tag. HTML tags are typically written in pairs, the start or opening tag <h1> and the end or closing tag </h1>. The difference being that the end tag has a forward slash.

It is very important to start and end your tags for the web browser to completely understand what you have written. However, some tags are self-closing like the image tag <img>and the single break line tag <br>.

  

Attributes

Attributes are mostly defined with an opening tag and they provide more information about an element. They comprise of a name and a value. For example \*<a href=”[https://start.ng](https://start.ng/)”>Start NG</a>\*

<a> is the name, the href attribute contains a value which is the link you to another web page or content within a page.

During the course of the HTML introductory class, we were exposed to the fundamentals about HTML such as elements, tags, classes, attributes, tables, forms etc.

  

We were tasked with creating a webpage which serves as a web version of our Resumé. This was an interesting task, especially since we were tasked to code without any style. in my implementation I primarily made use of tables to structure the webpage.

733,1925,why CSS has made HTML much better.,"CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices .

with css was able to arrange my CV, add colors, fonts and do many other styling and decorations on my CV that i built with a HTML .CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page.

So if HTML is the foundation, frames, walls, and girders supporting your website, consider  CSS the paint color, window styles, and landscaping that comes on afterward. You can’t get anywhere without putting that foundation up first, but—once you do—you’ll want to follow up with some style, and CSS is the ticket to unleashing your inner decorator.

Web browsers apply **CSS** rules to a document to affect how they are displayed.

 A **CSS** rule is formed from: A set of properties, which have values set to update how the **HTML** content is displayed, for example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be royal blue.![](/storage/1925/images/img-85lftnjwo9.png)![](/storage/1925/images/img-3co1g7z9eo.png)![](/storage/1925/images/img-zfzsirg4eg.png)",,why-css-has-made-html-much-better-cf5,8/27/2019 16:17,8/28/2019 12:30,1,,,

735,1925,why CSS has made HTML much better.,"CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices .

with css was able to arrange my CV, add colors, fonts and do many other styling and decorations on my CV that i built with a HTML .CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page.

So if HTML is the foundation, frames, walls, and girders supporting your website, consider  CSS the paint color, window styles, and landscaping that comes on afterward. You can’t get anywhere without putting that foundation up first, but—once you do—you’ll want to follow up with some style, and CSS is the ticket to unleashing your inner decorator.

736,2227,The Journey So Far (start.ng Tasks),"### **HNG Pre-Internship Program Day 02**

It's been exciting so far. In just two days, I have been tasked with writing blog posts, using google docs and sheets, and cloudinary. Most of these tasks have been quite easy, but one stands out because it wasn't so easy: recreating my CV using only HTML.

  

#### **The Challenge:** I have never created a CV using HTML before. I have been practicing with HTML, and CSS but this is my first really challenging project and I was a bit nervous.

  

#### **My Solution:** I did some research, and I asked a couple of my friends for help. Nariel and Agbo Daniel came through with a few tips for me, and I started building my CV using HTML Tables.

  

**Take a look at my code**

746,154,CSS Rules,"CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the code that tells the browser how to style the content of an HTML document by using rules to describe how the different HTML elements should be displayed.

By changing the style sheet you can dramatically change the appearance of your web page without changing any of the underlying content. Without CSS, your content will still show up on your web page, but it will appear rather plain.

  

  

To explore what CSS looks like and how it can change the appearance of a web page, visit a website using Microsoft Edge or your favorite browser. Enable Developer Tools under the Settings. 

  

In Microsoft Edge, you can click on an element on the page to inspect the CSS properties that control the line width, font size, and more.

  

You should now be able to read through the source code and recognize many of the HTML elements there. Up in the <head> section of the source code you may notice a link to a ""style sheet"". The style sheet file is the external CSS file that holds much of the information about how the web page should appear including colors, images, fonts, formatting, and more.

  

Though lines of CSS code can be mixed in with your HTML content and code, the best practice is to have one separate file for your CSS rules. This file is called an external CSS style sheet and is linked to from your website’s html files. Having the CSS code in one file makes it easier to change or update the style of the different elements of your whole website, simply by making changes to that one file. Your CSS file should have the extension "".css""

  

**in adding CSS to my CV i used the external styles listed below**

  

  

**body {background-color: lightgreen;} **

  

**h1 { **

** color: lightsalmon;**

**}**

  

**h2 { **

** color: lightsalmon;**

** color: orangered;**

**}**

  

**tr:hover {**

** background-color: #87CEEB;**

**Organizing your CSS rules**

**There are three different ways to define a style for your website:**

**Style Location Scope**

1.  **Inline : Inside an element tag Rules only apply to selected element**
2.  **Internal : In the header of a web page** **Rules only apply to that one page**

I learnt about HTML today and now I know that it means hyper text mark up language and it makes up the basic structure of any website. That is, it gives the content structure and meaning. I learnt common HTML terms like elements, tags, attributes and so on, so if you hear me say those terms all the time, just know I am doing the HTML speak (hahaha).

  

  

I also had a task to do. Use HTML to rewrite my CV. At first I thought it would be so difficult but after going through the class notes and asking some interns for help, it didn't seem like such a mountain to climb anymore. Let me show you a sneak peek.

762,700,What's HTML without CSS,"**Cascading Style Sheets**.... If you've ever tried to get into programming or probably any tech related field you must have heard of or attempted to write a bit of this magical stuff called CSS.

  

In my opinion with regards the current web development settings, there are three foundational languages every web developer should know or have a grasp of. These are HTML, CSS, JS.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language as we know is more or less like the backbone of web development, on which so many other languages, frameworks and the likes rest and those still to come will rest on. Now HTML as popularly described is like the skeleton of the entire web page, assuming a webpage is a building.

Now I'd use this simple analogy imagine a building being built just before painting and everything fancy on it. Would it look nice? **_HELL NO._**

This goes as well for building a web page, a design is needed for beautification of webpages and this is where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in.

  

Let's take a look at a code sample beneath

765,72,THE RELATION BETWEEN HTML AND CSS,"CSS and HTML are like Siamese twins, at least in a loose sense. They were made for each other. One could say that CSS is the ""missing rib"" of HTML.

  

CSS an important role in web design, and in relation with HTML. CSS allows you to develop the overall look of your website. While HTML focuses on the content and structure of a website, CSS is concerned with elements of presentation such as layout, font and color. Before CSS came to be used, all these elements had to be included within the HTML itself, which made the documents more complex. This division of functions between HTML and CSS allows web designers greater control over the web pages.

  

Another function of CSS is that it allows the same page to be rendered differently in different mediums such as print, on screen or even tactile devices.

  

CSS is compatible with most web browsers and is also user friendly. It allows you to position and reposition the components of a web page with relative ease. The most essential function of CSS which makes it so integral to web design is its focus on layout over content. Every aspect of layout in a web page can be altered and controlled with ease using CSS, thus making the task of a web designer so much simpler.

  

CSS complements HTML. While HTML can perform without CSS, they shine best when paired together.

The image above was created with html with no styling whatsoever. Right now you get a page which is effective but not pleasant to the eyes, in other words a very blank html page but lets look at the second image.

i know you wont believe this but this is the same html page only now it comes with styling which was made possible with the help of css. the following styling has been added:

*   _changes to the background._
*   _the image is inline withe the table._
*   _the contents in the table has been highlighted._
*   _the caption used also has also increased in size._",,why-css-has-made-html-so-much-better-608,8/27/2019 17:15,8/28/2019 12:30,1,,,

talking about the improvements , i suggest that if the platform can apply group tasking, it will helps to encourage and foster the learning process there by linking up all in term of closer communication and having someone close to always ask of any thing in case the need arises.

Today i will be talking about my first HTML page although it has my CV in it, i know you will like it and in case you have a job vacancy for me to fill in, my CV is just there for you.

Ok, my page is quite basic.I used only html to create it, the basic attributes of html such as <!Doctype html> to show the type of html, <h1>, <pre>,<p> (respectively for heading, to give a unique writing format and to give a paragraph), the most important that gave the page a nice structure is <table> attribute(basically an attribute to make a table), i used the <ol> attribute which is used to create an organised list (i used this to write up my skills), <strong> attribute to bolden some headers.

So thats basically all the functions i used in creating my html page. Some attributes mentioned in the second paragraph such as <ol> and <table> have some other attributes under them which i used to make the page live.

Below is the output of my html code on the browser:

A look at [http://www.csszengarden.com/](http://www.csszengarden.com/) will show you individuals across the world who put this theory into practice, with unique designs from flowery to techy from one html, it showcases the power of CSS.

Then year in year out it looks like software is eating the world which only made me more interested but ‘adulting’ took its toll on me with holding a steady but very demanding job in the Quality department of a multinational FMCG company.

Then we also had the twin-time swallower of Youtube and Twitter to deal with, so may hours man, so many hours went there laughing while deep within I was weeping at the hours I could be using to do more productive stuff.

Oh well, that went and ironically while scrolling on Twitter (I keep saying uncool stuff about that website but it really has helped a lot) stumbled on the internship stuff, I registered and here we are so far, keeping late nights after work after some few minutes or hours of Twitter and YouTube to end up writing about my experience of writing codes – _sounds bad-ass when I talk about me coding._

Now here I am learning how to link pages to websites, attach pictures and writing my first bit of code, this is still a bit crude and nothing to be boastful of, but before one becomes a master, we all have to start at zero level and work our way up, that is where I am at the moment, a bit of it is shown below

808,1043,CSS: The Best Thing Since Jollofrice,"So far, i would like to liken HTML and CSS to building of a house. While HTML would include digging and laying of the foundation, setting of blocks, plastering and attaching windows, door etc, CSS is in-charge of how everything will look like which include color of the house and material, font, position, shine and pattern. I also discovered that even though HTML can function without CSS, it looks shallow and not aesthetic. HTML without CSS is like the map of Africa without Madagascar. 

  

When I first started with the HTML, the resume looks horrible and the layout seem off, then i applied CSS synthases like position, margin, padding etc. And with CSS, I discovered that it more of an art that science, the more you try, the more it looks better and later realized that maybe you have overdone the design. Note to self to read up on design pattern articles and maybe explore some videos on youtube.

After applying, deleting and reapplying, here is something I came up with

809,455,Spicing things up with CSS,"CSS is one of my favourites :). It's so great making something that was previously ugly into something that's much less ugly (dare I say beautiful). And the magic that people can and have done with CSS makes me want to become so much better so that I can one day dazzle millions with the craziest website designs you ever saw (lmao, as if).

###   

### **The difficulty**

Doing this task wasn't particularly difficult; not anywhere near the 'difficulty' of the previous task. In that task, tables were a hassle. HTML tables are great when you need to make tables. When you don't, while powerful, they quickly become confusing. And that's what's great about CSS. You can (technically) order your HTML however you want and then completely transform it with CSS (though, obviously, it's best to keep the order predictable.

  

### **Getting rid of the table**

Was my favourite thing, lol. I couldn't wait to leave that clunky mess and start using proper semantic HTML5 tags. I have so many articles and sections now. And even more headers probably (I'm too lazy to check). And now that the table was gone, I could order the content much more naturally and didn't need placeholder comments for missing cells or rowspans or whatever.

  

### **And the colours!!!** **😍**

Finally, it's no longer a bland, feelingless blob of text. It lives!!

  

### **Results**

After all the madness, I managed to get to this:

![](/storage/455/images/img-afisor9nlo.png)

from this:

![](/storage/455/images/img-z2tyrjyauh.png)

which, in my opinion, is a big improvement.

  

And, another cool thing. I got my HTML down from 167 lines to 124 (that's how bulky the tables were, and I still have so many non-necessary tags for no reason in particular.)

Early October in the year 1996, Hakon Wium Lie, Tim Berners Lee co-creator of the World Wide Web came to the rescue of web developers , by inventing a new technology which is now popularly known as CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets which literally means using style sheets to abrogate the default style of the HTML pages. CSS beautifies web pages and make it look enticing.

820,892,THE BIGGER PICTURE WITH CSS,"CSS means “Cascading Style Sheet."" Cascading style sheets are used to change the layout of Web pages. CSS can be used to define styles suitable to make a web page user friendly and colourful.  

  

CSS helps to create a uniform look cutting across several pages of a Web site. It makes it possible to define the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, styles that are used more often than usual are defined only once  in a CSS document.

  

CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to change the default h1 tag by adding some color to it, from a colour black to a color green for over twenty pages of a Web site. If the pages all point to the same style sheet, the colour only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the color green.

  

While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the padding, margin and border around images or text or other object.. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today adopt cascading style sheets to build their web sites.

  

Below is an example of how CSS transforms a web page from its normal Mark Up to something more interesting and defined.

I just started, so I don't have much to write, but I'm enough completing my task 1, so that must count for something.. I'm particularly interested in Machine Learning (Python and R) and it's application.

The classes are running smoothly and they are doing a top notch job.. Kudos to the team

Css allows you to position elements anywhere you like on a webpage.css is compatible with all web browsers this ensures faster loading times and minimum maintenance. Css is also made up of style rules this rules are made of of 3 parts.

·            Selector: HTML tag

·            Property: HTML attribute

·            Value: indicates parameters of the selected properties.

  

They are 4 ways css can be applied to a webpage in my page I used the first 2 from the list below.

·            Internal: using <style> tag

·            Internal: using style attribute

·            External: using <link> tag

·            Imported: using @ import

  

Some of of the uses of css

  

·            Compatibility:

Be it old or new version css a user can be confident knowing that older and newer version off css work the same.

·             E-commerce domain:

Css has helped the application framework styling and looks which are used from small to large scale industries.

·            Website maintenance:

Css makes websites look and feel more flexible so it can be altered any time in a convenient manner.

I must confess that working with CSS on my website has actually given me the zeal to learn more of scripting languages, CSS has some interesting features that enables you to create user-friendly web page such as margin,background-color,borders,font-family e.t.c

Using CSS with my html has really made me fall in love with my web site, Looking at my CV background color and any other color you can view on my screenshot was done with the help of CSS.

With my experience when using CSS, I can attest to the fact that CSS is much more better than HTML. On this note i recommend that every intending web developer should learn how to use CSS effectively for a better and productive outputs on your web page..

853,2,YOUR HIGH IQ WILL KILL YOUR STARTUP,"<p>In 2004 I was in Brazil, walking down the hill in Lapa to get some lunch. I was with a friend who I had met in the hostel I was staying – his name was Ofer. We were having a discussion about intelligence, and what role it plays in success.</p>
<p>Then out of the side of the road stepped a man. He was holding a knife in one hand and a bottle in the other hand. He spoke to us in fast Portuguese, clearly asking us to hand over the things we held. I stood there, not very sure what to do. Ofer started speaking quickly to the man, telling the man not to rob us.</p>
<p>What you have to know about Ofer is that he had been an Israeli soldier. He hated violence of any form, but he knew how to be violent.</p>
<p>The man threw the bottle on the floor and it broke into pieces, he picked up the bottle and lunged at us. I ran a short distance off, and Ofer stood there and dodged the man, all the while talking to him. The man attacked several times, and each time Ofer just moved aside.</p>
<p>Then finally, Ofer kicked the weapons out of the guys hands, punched him, and he fell. He then told me to run, and we ran down the hill to the restaurant.</p>
<p>We sat there and he continued what we had spoken about. He said: That demonstrates what I mean. The man with the knife did not know how to use that knife. If he had been as trained in knife fighting as I was in hand combat, he would have been able to destroy me. But he had a tool that he felt gave him an advantage, but it’s nothing compared to a person who has no tool, but has worked to develop what he has.</p>
<p>Intelligence is like a knife. If you are intelligent, you are at a clear advantage against people who are not intelligent. But if you are intelligent, and another person is not as intelligent, but the other person is willing to train harder than you, the other person will very quickly overtake you in ability.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW YOUR INTELLIGENCE WILL DESTROY YOU</strong></h3>
<p>People who are born intelligent start off life with everything easy for them. They don’t have to work hard to get good grades; they never really have to do much to get ahead. The major challenge of early life is school – and school is designed for average people. So intelligent people just breeze through.</p>
<p>But there is a point where every intelligent person faces something that requires more than intelligence. It requires hard work, it requires the ability to fail, it requires being able to do tough tasks, boring tasks. For the first time in their life, in spite of their intelligence, these intelligent people are challenged, and they start failing. Like when they first attempt to create a start-up.</p>
<p>And that’s where most of them retreat. They focus on things they can’t fail on, and ignore the other important things. They start to blame other things (like the school system). They procrastinate. They refuse to face new problems because they know they will not be able to handle them, and this does not fit into their worldview that they are invincible.</p>
<p>Let me tell another story. In 2007, I had dinner with the father of my girlfriend in Paris. He is currently a vice president at one of the top 5 consulting companies in the world. He is a Jewish french immigrant from Morocco – he came in the 70s to France with no money and no connections, and he made it up to become Vice President, even though he studied to be an engineer.</p>
<p>I asked him: How did you do it? How did you start from being an immigrant to become executive material? He told me: I got this far because I’m intelligent. He continued: But there were many many people as intelligent as I am who graduated together with me. They are still engineers right now. The difference between me and them is that when I arrived, I knew that I did not have family here in France, I did not have connections. And I knew there were a lot of other people as intelligent as I was, and who had all these advantages. The only way to be successful then would be to gain a slight advantage over them – I had to work and train harder than they did, I had to get to know more people than they did, I had to learn more about more things that they did.</p>
<p>We started off equals, but at some point all the effort I put in started to pay off, and where they stopped improving themselves, I continued, and I got better and better. Where they were afraid to try new things because they would fail, I tried and I got better and knew more, till I was good enough for the job I hold now.</p>
<h2><strong>HOW THIS RELATES TO YOU</strong></h2>
<p>Being intelligent is like having a knife. If you train every day in using the knife, you will be invincible. If you think that just having a knife will make you win any battle you fight, then you will fail. This believe in your own inherent ability is what will kill your start-up. Success comes from the work and ability you put in becoming better than the others, and not from some brilliance you feel you may have within you.</p>
<p>So don’t believe that the brilliance of your idea is what will make you successful. What will make you successful is when you are out there every day, doing something new, challenging yourself, trying new methods, studying new ways, having a lot of small failures, then getting better every day.</p>",,your-high-iq-will-kill-your-startup-511,8/30/2019 10:16,8/30/2019 10:16,,,,
854,2,A CHINESE VILLAGER WHO SELLS MORE SOFTWARE DAILY THAN YOU DO,"<p>I was alone in the center of a small Chinese town, the weakly glowing streetlights hardly illuminating the streets. The silence was heavy and absolute. It was different from the eternal light and sound of Shenzhen, and the high elevation gave the air an unusual taste. Things were not the same up here in the mountains, and this strangeness seemed a bit menacing. The roads had been tarred, courtesy of the rich central government who gave special attention to the Chinese minorities, but the villages up here in the mountains of Yunnan province did not have many cars to wear down the roads. So they felt incomplete, and leaves lay about, their crushing beneath my feet giving my walk a strange soundtrack.</p>
<p>A group of men sat in a doorway smoking tobacco from a big bong, watching me walk past with impassive faces. I hurried a bit. What I was looking for was near, I knew. I turned a corner into a small side street, and saw it – the red and blue glow of the humming fluorescent lights, the pictures of the scantily clad lady with big breasts. I had found the local internet cafe.</p>
<p>I walked in through the narrow doorway, squeezing past a young teenage couple holding hands and staring out of the door. The guy had a scar across his forehead, I wondered idly what their story was, it may have been an amazing love story, it could have been endlessly tragic, perhaps they were completely boring. I’ll never know, because I walked into that room and was hit by the combined glow of hundreds of computer screens, different figures danced across many screens in some dance dance revolution clone, colourful websites reflected off the eyes of engrossed guys, smoking men scrolled through the news, cliques of teens starred together at a screen and shouted and laughed. The room was huge and it was filled with people surfing the internet and playing games. The internet cafe, long thought to be dead, had simply retreated here into the mountains, and it fed the local population with all the entertainment they could not afford to have at home.</p>
<p>After the necessary registration with my passport at the counter, I bought an entire night of internet surfing, starting off by checking what was new at techcrunch. I went through the usual schedule of websites I read, skipping only facebook and twitter, as they don’t work here.</p>
<p>Being the only foreigner in there, I was getting a lot of looks, giggles and yelled out “HELLOs” from the kids around. I expected them to come talk to me at some point, so when someone tapped my shoulder, I was suprised that rather than some spiky haired teenager, it was a somewhat middle-aged smiling man with a cigarette dangling from his lip. He introduced himself with the sentence: “TechCrunch is my favorite website, too”. His english was heavily accented, but good.</p>
<p>I simply looked up at him, unsure what to reply. I didn’t need to say anything, because he started talking to me about the last few articles he had read on TechCrunch. I got only a few sentences in, mostly in agreement with his somewhat unusual but pretty insightful opinions about what they wrote. He spoke as if he had never spoken to anyone about TechCrunch, and needed to get all his thoughts out.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of mostly listening, he invited me out to have a drink with him and his friends. He excitedly made phone calls in the local dialect and we went out. We walked over to some local food place, and sat outside on plastic chairs, several beers quickly appearing on the table. Soon, several of his friends popped in a shinily new BYD car, and they joined me.</p>
<p>He told me what he does: he sells software. And he sells a lot of software. Every month, he makes more than $5000, which is more than 50 times the average salary where he lives. He told me how he does it, and it’s a bit unusual.</p>
<p>He had learnt how to program from a friend of his. They had both moved to Kunming and started working, but when his dad got sick, he had to go home and farm to keep the family alive. His dad was sick for close to a year, and they needed money. Unable to travel, he had started looking for jobs on Odesk, Rentacoder and such sites based on recommendation from his friend. After writing some software for a client, he noticed something important:</p>
<p><em>If he simply looked at the list of software projects available for jobs, he would have ideas on what software to develop.</em></p>
<p>He did this, and rather than making software for clients, he created his own software products, which he put on the internet. He said that 3 days after he copied a simple idea from the rentacoder list on his website, he was making 2 sales a day. $20 per day, which basically doubled his monthly earnings as a farmer. He continued working on more products and copying more ideas, and soon he had 10 different software that he was selling. Sales were low at the start, but even then for him it was a lot of money.</p>
<p>He kept doing this, cloning software he found that people wanted by looking at open projects on rentacoder, most of his software being related to video encoding. Additionally, he would take open source software, change the way it looked and sell it online. He said he’d get a few refunds, but most people would purchase it without complaining. He said he tried selling Firefox for a while, but sales were very low due to the free competition.</p>
<p>At the moment he’s making more than $5,000 a month, and he’s been making it for more than 4 years already. He’s one of the bigger players in the video encoding software market.</p>
<p>As I left, he dropped me off at the local hotel where my friends were. He shook my hand enthusiastically and said he would email me, but that he had to sleep now, because he had to go to the farm early the next morning. Surprised, I asked him why he still farmed. He shrugged and lifted his palms in that typical smiling manner that the villagers there have. “No why!” he said. “I enjoy farming”.</p>",,a-chinese-villager-who-sells-more-software-daily-than-you-do-e1d,8/30/2019 10:16,8/30/2019 10:16,,,,
855,2,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"<p>When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.</p>
<p>For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.</p>
<p>There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.</p>
<p>Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.</p>
<p>First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!</p>
<p>For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.</p>
<p>Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.</p>",,build-around-your-discovery-mechanism-100,8/30/2019 10:16,8/30/2019 10:16,,,,
856,2,DON'T ASK WHY YOU WERE REJECTED,"<p>I’ve noticed something that is not immediately obvious - rejections without explanations can be supremely helpful.</p>
<p>Imagine you are applying for a job, or for funding for a project of yours. You are confident going in – everything seems to be in place, and you are sure you will get accepted. But then you get rejected. The first question you will ask is : why? You want to know from the person exactly why you were unsuitable.</p>
<p>If the other party, however, does not give any reasons why you were rejected, this can be valuable to you. When people get rejected, they tend to reevaluate their initial concept under very critical eyes. What seemed perfect going in now seems riddled with flaws that could have been responsible for the rejection. The scales fall of their project and they can see it clearly. They fall out of love, and suddenly the lines on their lovers face are visible, and the once charming idiosyncrasies have become ugly flaws.</p>
<p>Being rejected without explanation allows people re-see their project and potentially abandon it or change it into something better. Being rejected with explanations gives them false hope – they focus then on only that small flaw that was pointed out to them and think fixing it would solve the problem.</p>
<p>But often, the explanation given is diplomatic and designed not to burn bridges, it’s not actual helpful advice that one can work on. So a rejection <em>with</em> reason can unnecessarily extend a project that should rightfully be dead. Or it could cause an over-focus on this one area, and all of the other flaws that were not listed in the reason (like personality flaws), go completely unworked on.</p>
<p>Getting rejected without reason is the best type of rejection, because it forces you to improve all aspects of your project. For a while, it allows you think and actually understand the problem. That’s because you’ll discover the problem by yourself.</p>",,dont-ask-why-you-were-rejected-490,8/30/2019 10:16,8/30/2019 10:16,,,,
857,2,THE SUNFLOWER,"<p>A field of sunflowers sat beside another field covered with grass. Perhaps long ago that grass field was a pasture for animals, but now there was nothing there except an old tractor in the corner.</p>
<p>An unusual gust of wind, going against the direction the wind usually went in that area, lifted a few sunflower seeds from a particularly full sunflower, and dropped them in the grassy field.</p>
<p>All but one died very quickly, the tangle of the grass preventing them from taking root. One particularly hardy (or perhaps lucky) sunflower seed, however, defied the odds and started to grow.</p>
<p>On a fine morning, that sunflower bloomed and showed its bright yellow face. As the light hit it, it became aware of where it was. It looked around at all the whispering grass, and knew already, it was different. The belief grew stronger and stronger, till one day, it broke through all the grass and it saw across to the sunflower field.</p>
<p>What joy it felt in its heart in that moment! It saw all the other sunflowers, yellow and glorious, so different from the grass that had surrounded it. Once in a while, the wind would bring the glorious singing of those sunflowers across, and this lone sunflower rejoiced at those voices, so different from the raspy whispering of the grass around it.</p>
<p>But it wondered - look how big and glorious those sunflowers are. And I am so small and misshapen. They sing so wonderfully, while my voice is cracked and muted.</p>
<p>The sunflower grew sadder and sadder by the day, and at some point, thought that that must be the reason he was sent to this grassy field - he did not fit in with the glory of all the other sunflowers. He watched little sunflowers grow big and bloom, while his petals stayed small and stunted.</p>
<p>Then he figured it out. The reason he was small and stunted was because he was in the grassy field. If he could go over to the other field, then he would be in the soil that was best for sunflowers and he would grow to be as magnificent as they were.</p>
<p>Being a plant, he was not sure how exactly he could go about moving to another field. So he asked a knot of grass close by - “Hey, do you know how I can go across to the other field?”</p>
<p>The grassy lump looked at him in silence for a while: “Sunflower, you’ve never spoken to us all this while you have been growing here. We are your neighbours, we’ve lived together all our lives. Why do you want to leave us and go live with the other sunflowers?</p>
<p>We’ve heard you complain for so long about how small your petals are, and how great the sunflowers over there are doing. You know why your petals are so small and stunted?</p>
<p>Because, Sunflower, you have turned your head to look to that field! You are a sunflower, look at the sun! All the looking into the other field is what has prevented you from being as magnificent as they are! Just turn to the sun and forget about the other field.”</p>
<p>The Sunflower, ashamed, saw that the grass was right. And he turned to the sun. In a few days, he bloomed and started growing. Soon, his petals were as big as the grandest from the other field - all the grass had made his soil very fertile.</p>
<p>A few years later, that grassy field was filled with grand sunflowers - children of that original sunflower - all looking proudly to the sun, growing and singing.</p>
<p>Till one day, again, another seed floated gently on an unusual gust of wind, into the next grassy field.</p>",,the-sunflower-9ab,8/30/2019 10:16,8/30/2019 10:16,,,,
